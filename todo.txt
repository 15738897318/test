- Turn off display window when using finger capturing.
- Will be nice to have auto start, stop for face. E.g.: it detects when I put my face on the camera and auto start. Same for stop. This will impress people, and Cardiio does not have this.

- Speed improve:
	+ matlab.h functions:			convert to passing (params) by reference
	+ matToVector1D(Mat m):		convert to passing (params) by reference
	+ Change CV_64 --> CV_32 and test the result.
	+ Access a image in optimize order: http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/core/how_to_scan_images/how_to_scan_images.html


- Remove temp files (images, videos) after calculate.
- Update % progess when run_algorithms().
- Use Doxygen to generate document files.



------------------------------
Comments:
	+ We should focus on finger for now. At least the demo should run smoothly and correctly with this mode first.

Nice to have:
