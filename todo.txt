- Bugs:
	+ Eulerian output video.
	+ Test corrDn.
	+ frame2signal():
		+ first_tranning_frames_start


- Speed improve:
	+ matlab.h functions:			convert to passing (params) by reference
	+ matToVector1D(Mat m):		convert to passing (params) by reference
	+ Change CV_64 --> CV_32 and test the result.
	+ use 1 channel only (R in rgb (0) and S in TSL (1))
	+ Access a image in optimize order: http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/core/how_to_scan_images/how_to_scan_images.html


- Remove temp files (images, videos) after calculate.
- Update % progess when run_algorithms().
- Use Doxygen to generate document files.


- change names of functions:
	+ eulerian
	+ temporal_mean_calc
	+ frame2signal

Comments:
	+ We should focus on finger for now. At least the demo should run smoothly and correctly with this mode first.

Nice to have:
	+ Will be nice to have auto start, stop for finger. E.g.: it detects when I put my finger on the camera and auto start. Same for stop. This will impress people, and Cardiio does not have this.
	+ Less important: Use a short name, acronym for the app
	+ Turn off display window when using finger capturing.
